The notebook provided is an analysis of the Palmer Penguins dataset. The pathway to download the dataset is written in the first line of code so all you need to be able to do is download the script and open in Jupyter notebook.

The analysis conducted was to see if the three different Antartic penguin species could be distunguished by their morphological features using a Nearest Neighbours model. The specific characteristics found suitble for this model were bill depth (mm) and bill length (mm). A model of 0.94 confidence was produced showing that these specific charaterisitcs could be used with relative confidence to destinguish penguins of these three species. However for future development it would be interesting to assess the confidence of this model for individual data points - for example predictions of data within the orignial dataset cluster vs those the lie at the boundry edge. So that for each new penguin measured the confidence of the prediction could be more accuraltey determined.

Further analysis that would be extremely interesting to conduct would involve statistically assessing the differences in each morpholigcal characteristic within the data and seeing if this has any ecological relevance for each species. For example, as seen in this analysis, each species has a distinct beak morphology. It would be interesting to know if these differences were statistically signifcant and whether the ecology and lifestyles of the different species might be able to explain these differneces in morphology.
